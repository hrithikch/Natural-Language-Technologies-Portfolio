## Using WordNet for Semantic Analysis
[Analyzing the meanings of words](https://github.com/hrithikch/Natural-Language-Technologies-Portfolio/blob/main/NLP_wordnet.ipynb) utilizing WordNet. Sysnets are the heirarchical structures of words, their meanings, and their relationships. Words may be superior or subordinate based on how general or specific they are, and there are other relationships like antonyms or part-whole. These hierarchies can be used by algorithms like Wu-Palmer and lesk to identify word similarity and specific word sense of a word. Further tools include SentiWordNet, which provides the connotative polarity used for sentiment analysis, and collocations, which can be used to identify if there are certain pairs of words that come together to create a new, unique meaning in a text.
